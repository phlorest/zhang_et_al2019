# Notes

## Data:

> To minimize the word lateral transfers, in this study we chose only the words with meaning inside the Swadesh 100-word list, since they are relatively resistant to borrowing2. Due to semantic drift, each etymon could correspond to several meanings in the ST languages, so we manually checked the word entries with a STEDT-labelled etymon and a meaning within the range of Swadesh 100 words. For example, the etymon #231 *krak may have two meanings “blood” and “red”, we will take #231- “blood” and #231- “red” as two separate root-meaning (RM) traits. An RM in this study has the similar meaning to a “cognate set” in the Indo-European paper 4,5, rather than only c
